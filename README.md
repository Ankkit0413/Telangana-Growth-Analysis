## Project Overview

This project explores various data sources provided by the Telangana government, analyzing revenue, seasonal trends, and investment data to identify growth patterns in sectors such as **Stamp Registration**, **Transportation**, and **TS-iPASS** (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System). 

By diving into these datasets, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can aid the Telangana government in enhancing economic growth and optimizing resource allocation.

## Data Sources

The data for this project is sourced from [Open Data Telangana](https://data.telangana.gov.in/), which offers public access to datasets across various sectors. For this analysis, we focused on:
- **Stamp Registration**: Document registration revenue and e-stamp challan data.
- **Transportation**: Vehicle registration and sales data by district.
- **TS-iPASS**: Investment and industry sector data.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze growth trends** across the selected sectors to identify potential areas of development.
2. **Provide insights** on seasonal patterns, district-wise revenue, and investment trends.
3. **Generate recommendations** for government policymakers to support Telangana’s sustainable growth.

## Key Analysis Areas

### 1. Stamp Registration
   - Revenue from document registrations across different districts.
   - Comparison of revenue generated from e-stamp challans vs. traditional document registration.
   - Classification of districts based on stamp registration revenue.

### 2. Transportation
   - Analysis of seasonal trends in vehicle registrations across districts.
   - Breakdown of vehicle classes and distribution patterns.
   - Identification of the top and bottom districts for vehicle sales growth between FY 2021 and FY 2022.

### 3. TS-iPASS
   - Overview of the top five sectors attracting significant investments in FY 2022.
   - Analysis of the top three districts for investment from FY 2019 to FY 2022.
   - Exploration of the correlation between investments, vehicle sales, and stamp revenue.
   - Seasonal analysis of investment patterns.

## Tools & Skills Used

### Tools
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
- **PowerPoint**: To organize and present insights.
- **ChatGPT**: Used to assist in summarizing insights.
- **Clipchamp**: For video editing in the final project presentation.
- **AI Voice Over**: For Audio making in the project.

### Skills
- **Data Modeling**: Structured data models for efficient analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and processed raw data for meaningful insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visuals to communicate trends and insights.
- **DAX**: Utilized DAX expressions to calculate metrics (e.g., sales growth, revenue growth).
- **Prompt Engineering**: Used for refining analytical queries and generating summaries.

## Results & Insights

1. **Stamp Registration**:
   - Identified districts with high and low revenue from document registrations.
   - E-stamp challans show distinct patterns in some districts, suggesting room for digital adoption improvements.

2. **Transportation**:
   - Seasonal trends indicate peak vehicle registration periods across districts.
   - Variation in vehicle class distribution shows differing transportation needs by region.
   - FY 2022 saw significant growth in specific districts, pointing to targeted economic activity.

3. **TS-iPASS**:
   - The top five sectors for investments in FY 2022 are identified, with a notable increase in manufacturing and IT.
   - Certain districts consistently attract high levels of investment, indicating regional economic hubs.
   - A positive correlation was found between investments, vehicle sales, and stamp revenue, suggesting these metrics are key indicators of regional economic activity.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations for the Telangana government:
1. **Promote Digital Registration**: Increase awareness and infrastructure for e-stamp challans to streamline document registration.
2. **Targeted Investment in Transportation**: Districts with low vehicle sales growth could benefit from government initiatives to improve transportation access and infrastructure.
3. **Encourage Investment in High-Growth Sectors**: Continue to support industries that have shown substantial growth in recent years, particularly in tech and manufacturing.
4. **Monitor Seasonal Trends**: Leverage seasonal registration and investment trends to allocate resources more effectively during peak periods.
5. **Expand Economic Hubs**: Encourage development in emerging districts showing economic growth to spread prosperity more evenly across the state.
